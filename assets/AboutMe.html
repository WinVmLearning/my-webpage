    <h1> About Me </h1>
    I am a business administration professional with a strong foundation in IT project management and a dedicated focus on educational technology systems. I specialize in aligning technological initiatives with strategic objectives, particularly within academic and enterprise settings, to support meaningful digital transformation.<br> 
    Throughout my career, I have cultivated a unique combination of operational insight and technical proficiency, with practical experience in Full-Stack development, Agile methodologies, and the optimization of enterprise platforms. My work centers on developing systems that not only perform effectively behind the scenes but also provide a seamless and intuitive experience for end users. Whether overseeing platform transitions, coordinating cross-functional teams, or redesigning complex workflows, I prioritize both user needs and organizational impact. <br> A key strength I offer is the ability to translate business requirements into practical technical solutions. I am well-versed in both business and technology environments, which enables me to bridge communication gaps, enhance collaboration, and drive project success.<br> From developing support strategies for large-scale platforms to resolving complex system issues, I approach each task with a solution-oriented mindset informed by data and focused on outcomes.<br>I am particularly passionate about the field of educational technologyâ€”creating systems that advance institutional objectives while supporting students, educators, and administrators through accessible and intelligent tools.<br> I believe in the value of continuous process improvement and evidence-based decision-making to increase both efficiency and user satisfaction.<br>In all of my work, I strive to implement technology that serves people, not the other way around. I am consistently exploring new ways to innovate, refine processes, and deliver systems that enable organizations to succeed in an increasingly digital world. <br> Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my professional background. I welcome the opportunity to connect and collaborate on impactful initiatives.
